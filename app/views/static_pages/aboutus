    Our Story
  </h1>
  <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
    <p>
      Went to a meeting where Biz Stone spoke. All I could thinQ of during the entire time he talked was Twitter is so lame. I can come up with something better.
Several years earlier Had a vision for multi-location book party and Discovered livestreaming in 2008. This changes everything. Anyone can communicate with anyone with internet, computer
Experimented with live conversation formats, most (actors, talk show) were awful. Decided to call it ThinQ.tv in 2019.
Researched other video chats and was appalled - cussing contests, misogyny, pants off.
When covid19, people started gathering on ThinQ.tv to talk about news and activism. Got outreach & tech students together to host activism conversations every evening.
Since we were geographically dispersed & working from home, Dr. Schaefer required interns to work in chatrooms on ThinQ.tv.  Made it the office. Study hall (or whatever we will call it) evolved. Being woman engineer is an act of activism. Study hall is to advance women & minorities in tech, women-owned tech businesses.
