    Our Story
  </h1>
  <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
    <p>
      Back when ThinQ.tv Founder, Dr. Lisa Schaefer, lived in Washington, DC, she attended a meeting where Biz Stone spoke. All she could thinQ of during the entire meeting was, "Twitter is so lame. I can come up with something better."<br>

      Years earlier, Dr. Schaefer had a vision for multi-location book party and discovered livestreaming in its early days. "This changes everything," she thought. Anyone with a computer, webcam, and internet connection can communicate with anyone with anyone else who has an internet connection.<br>

      Dr. Schaefer developed her own web platform, embedded video chat, and experimented with talk show formats. Most were awful. People wanted to talk at the internet without listening to others in a dialogue. However the impromptu conversations that followed were worth coming back for.<br>

      In July 2019 Dr. Schaefer decided to call the platform ThinQ.tv. She researched video chat apps marketed to teens and young adults and was appalled - cussing contests, requests for nude photos (Dr. Schaefer is in her 50s), boys with their pants off. When COVID19 hit, more people gathered on ThinQ.tv to talk about substantive topics. Dr. Schaefer gathered outreach & tech students to host conversations every evening about Women in Tech, Black Lives Matter, and national news.<br>

      Since we were geographically dispersed & working from home, Dr. Schaefer required interns to work in chatrooms on ThinQ.tv. It became our office. Study Hall evolved. As a women-founded tech company, the purpose of ThinQ.tv's Study Hall is to advance women & minorities in tech and women-owned tech businesses. <br>

      "Being woman engineer is an act of activism," according to Dr. Schaefer. "Just showing up in spite of the harassment and the assumption that I don't belong here is an act of defiance. If my face goes away, so does my voice. Which leaves a vacuum of leadership for the upcoming generation of women."
