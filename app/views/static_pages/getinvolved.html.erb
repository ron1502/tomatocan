    Our Story
  </h1>
  <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
    <p>
      Back when ThinQ.tv Founder, Dr. Lisa Schaefer, lived in Washington, DC, she attended a meeting where Biz Stone spoke. All she could thinQ of during the entire meeting was, "I can come up with something better."<br><br>

      Years earlier, Dr. Schaefer had a vision for multi-location book party and discovered live-streaming in its early days. "This changes everything," she thought. Anyone with a computer, webcam, and internet connection can communicate with anyone with anyone else who has an internet connection.<br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer developed her own web platform, embedded video chat, and experimented with talk show formats. Most were awful. People wanted to talk at the internet without listening to others in a dialogue. However the impromptu conversations that followed were worth coming back for.<br><br>

      In July 2019 Dr. Schaefer decided to call the platform ThinQ.tv. She researched video chat apps marketed to teens and young adults and was appalled by the inappropriate and sexual behavior; she wanted to create a platform where this behavior was unacceptable and intellectual conversations were celebrated. When COVID19 hit, more people gathered on ThinQ.tv to talk about substantive topics. Dr. Schaefer gathered outreach & tech students to host conversations every evening about Women in Tech, Black Lives Matter, and national news.<br><br>

      Since we were geographically dispersed & working from home, Dr. Schaefer asks interns to work in chatrooms on ThinQ.tv. It has become our office and Study Hall has evolved. As a women-founded tech company, the purpose of ThinQ.tv's Study Hall is to share ideas and collaborate which consequently helps women and minorities in tech.<br><br>
      "Being woman engineer is an act of activism," according to Dr. Schaefer. "Just showing up in spite of the harassment and the assumption that I don't belong here is an act of defiance. If my face goes away, so does my voice. Which leaves a vacuum of leadership for the upcoming generation of women who will follow." <br><br>
